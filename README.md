# LogicMonitor CMDB Sync - Auto Balanced Collector Groups
### ServiceNow Update Set Documentation
Device assignment to collectors has traditionally been  a 1-to-1 relationship. The burden of managing those connections and ensuring that collectors are properly scaled and balanced fell to the customer. Device Creation also required a collector assignment. Deciding which Collector had the capacity to take on new devices takes creative guess work on the part of the customer with the only guidance based solely on device counts.

In May 2019 we announced Auto Balanced Collector Groups (ABCG) which streamlines the creation process for devices and allows for simplified capacity management within a group of Collectors.  With the 1.1.x release and this Auto Balanced Collector Group - Update Set itâ€™s now possible to provision devices to Auto Balanced Collector Groups or a specific collector from ServiceNow.
